        <p>
        I am a Network Technician/System Administrator with 7+ years of experience across multiple classifications of networks and equipment. I currently have a TS/SCI clearance with CI poly and am CompTIA Sec+ certified. In May of 2021 I will receive my associate degree in cybersecurity from Northern Virginia Community College. I consider myself a jack of all trades in the IT realm but have recently fell in love with coding. I have just over a year of experience with programming learned in an academic setting. My primary language is Python, however I first learned Java. Recently, Iâ€™ve devoted my free time towards learning web development basics (HTML, CSS, JS). I am looking to change my career path towards developing and will be continuing my education this fall at George Mason University.
